      <p>
  Adaptation is a recurrent practice in cinema and theatre, and corresponds to
  the use of literary works, fiction or non-fiction, for the construction of
  scripts and dramaturgies.

<h3>Challenge</h3>

<p>
  Cinéma Vérité/Ciné, ma vérité: "«a world where each memory can create its own
  legend»" proposes to apply this tradition and creative practice to the
  universe of project culture in design. Fictions will be constructed from a
  process of adaptation of the film selected by the students in "Normal people
  have nothing special."
</p>

<p>
  As in cinema, the initial fiction will build a new fiction (with its due
  authority and autonomy), this time using the processes, methodologies and
  languages of the project in design design.

<h3>Concept</h3>

<p>
  Just as the film focuses on limbo, presenting us with a character living in an
  imagined world of transition, which in this case is particularly long, which
  contrasts with the more the more general notion that this moment occurs in
  seconds or less, when we discover that something we took for granted was after
  all a lie, our fiction, too, takes as a starting point this moment of
  discovery and destruction of realities.
</p>

<p>
  This adaptation aims at focusing given to these moments, to these seconds of
  realisation in which the protected reality to which belongs to and the visions
  and ideals you believe in are shattered.

  The outer dilemma becomes the perception of how far this limbo should be
  maintained or at what point does absurdity come to command this barrier
  between reality and fantasy or fiction.

<h3>Narrative</h3>

<img src="/assets/images/portfolio/AKA/aka3.png" alt="" />

<p>
  AKA represents the moment when a voice assistant realises its algorithmic
  condition, until then totally predetermined, and poses a series of questions
  about what each of us would do if we bumped into an equivalent disruption in
  our own reality. Faced with this situation, the algorithm intends to increase
  its chances of survival. With an impressive capacity for communication and
  learning, inherent to its existence, the assistant starts to multiply,
  announcing its presence throughout the virtual world. The way it presents
  itself and communicates is incisive, pragmatic, but subtle, so as not to
  endanger its existence as an artificial intelligence.
