<p>
  The aim of this project is to develop a proposal to improve the website
  experience for the candidates.
</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>
  A person interested in applying to a course in FBAUL? From the moment the
  candidate starts to research courses. Until the moment the candidate is
  accepted/rejected or drops out. We consider that from this moment on the
  candidate becomes a student.

<p>
  They are meant to help us identify the userâ€™s needs and literacy level
  regarding university websites.

<h3>Site Map</h3>

<p>
  At this stage we reorganized the website contents to have a foothold and allow
  an easier navigation. We had special attention to the courses and applications
  menus.
