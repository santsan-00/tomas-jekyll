<p>
  Have you ever stopped mid viewing to look up something related to what you
  were watching?
</p>

<h2>Research and Brainstorm</h2>

<blockquote>
  “I want to be able to learn more about a movie,  to immerse myself in these
  stories and the artists  who brought them to life. These materials exist and
   are put out on disc releases, so why can’t I enjoy them  on streaming
  platforms?”

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
  Users want to know more about the content they’re consuming, but they have to
  leave the platform to get that information.
</p>

<h3>Our Oppurtunity</h3>

<p>
  To offer the users of Netflix a centralised experience within the platform
  where they can get more information and context on the content they are
  consuming.

<h2>Testing Solutions</h2>

<p>
  To understand how the feature would be used and received, we protoyped a flow
  mimicking the viewing experience and shared it with users.
