I"ñ<p>Adaptation is a recurrent practice in cinema and theatre, and corresponds to the use of literary works, fiction or non-fiction, for the construction of scripts and dramaturgies.</p>

<p>Cin√©ma V√©rit√©/Cin√©, ma v√©rit√©: ‚Äú¬´a world where each memory can create its own legend¬ª‚Äù proposes to apply this tradition and creative practice to the universe of project culture in design. Fictions will be constructed from a process of adaptation of the film selected by the students in ‚ÄúNormal people have nothing special.‚Äù</p>

<p>As in cinema, the initial fiction will build a new fiction (with its due authority and autonomy), this time using the processes, methodologies and languages of the project in design design.</p>

<p>Just as the film focuses on limbo, presenting us with a character living in an imagined world of transition, which in this case is particularly long, which contrasts with the more the more general notion that this moment occurs in seconds or less, when we discover that something we took for granted was after all a lie, our fiction, too, takes as a starting point this moment of discovery and destruction of realities.</p>

<p>This adaptation aims at focusing given to these moments, to these seconds of realisation in which the protected reality to which belongs to and the visions and ideals you believe in are shattered.</p>

<p>The outer dilemma becomes the perception of how far this limbo should be maintained or at what point does absurdity come to command this barrier between reality and fantasy or fiction.</p>
