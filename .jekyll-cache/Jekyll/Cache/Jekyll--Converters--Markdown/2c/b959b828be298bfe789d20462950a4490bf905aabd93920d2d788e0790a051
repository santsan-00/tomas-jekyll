  At the very least, the reports of the webâ€™s death have been greatly
  exaggerated. In 2010 Wired Magazine published The Web Is Dead | Long Live The
  Internet, regarding the demise of the PC and the shrinking need for the Web as
  a digital presence. The original argument from the authors states that in the
  new age of tablet devices, people would consume digital content via apps,
  which would kill the web as the main source of digital information.
