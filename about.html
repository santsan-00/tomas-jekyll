    <h1>Hello! I am Tomás.</h1>
    <h2>& I am a UX/UI Designer.</h2>

    <h3>My values</h3>
    <p>
      I am passionate about improving the lives of others through UX design. I
      believe diversity, inclusivity, honesty, and empathy are crucial to
      creating good design experiences (and that these traits are integral to
      team culture). I am a quick learner, eager problem-solver, and creative
      thinker — always ready to bring new ideas to the table.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      When I'm not designing, you can find me getting outside on the trails.
      I've competed in two long, distance trail races and recently ran my first
      ultra marathon. My husband and I love hiking with our dog, Murphy and
      traveling around our beautiful state of Colorado. And finally, I love
      baking sourdough! Ask me about it sometime and I'll make you a loaf.
